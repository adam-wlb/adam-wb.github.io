                <h2>Placement Year - IBM Hursley</h2>
                <h3>Software Developer: 2018 - 2019</h3>
                <h4>Core role</h4>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-6">
                        <h5>Developing Test Suites</h5>
                        <p>The bulk of my core role involved creating test suites to ensure new features that had been
                            developed for the product
                            were robust. This gave me experience in the full process of creating a set of tests: from
                            meeting with the developer
                            and other testers to understand how the feature worked, to brainstorming potential risks, to
                            deciding which risks
                            were the most important to test and actually writing the JUnit based tests themselves.</p>
                        <p>Key skills - Teamwork, Problem Solving, Testing, z/OS</p>
                        <h5>Converting Test Suites</h5>
                        <p>When I first started my placement, my role was to convert existing test suites from an old
                            framework to a new Java
                            based one. This gave me experience writing enterprise-quality Java in a clear and readable
                            manner as well as
                            experience with the product I needed to be able to move on to my later projects. This also
                            gave me the opportunity to
                            familiarise myself with source control and best practice within my team.</p>
                        <p>Key skills - Java, COBOL, z/OS</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-6">
                        <h5>Web Tools</h5>
                        <p>In addition to the primarily Java-based projects I completed, I also had the opportunity for
                            some web development. My
                            favourite project of the year, the 'Build Checker' tool gave me the opportunity to create a
                            tool that displayed the
                            progress of testing any given build of the product. It took the form of a web UI front-end,
                            with a Java back-end and a
                            Mongo database to provide and parse the data needed for the website to display various
                            charts and lists. Upon
                            completion, this tool was used throughout the department both to check progress on demand
                            and to provide data for
                            presentations to senior management.</p>
                        <p>Key skills - HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Java, MongoDB, Docker</p>

                <h4>Other projects</h4>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-6">
                        <h5>Volunteering</h5>
                        <p>I also took some time to volunteer on behalf of IBM for outreach purposes, something I really
                            enjoy. Throughout the
                            year, I took part in three 'TryScience' events. These days give primary school children to
                            explore STEM subjects
                            with help from IBM in their own schools, and help inspire the next generation to pursue STEM
                            subjects. I also manned a
                            stand at the 'Bing Bang Solent' careers event. This event saw around 1,000 students between
                            GCSE and college age visit
                            the venue. My role was to speak to the students and tell them about IBM's work, as well as
                            the various routes they
                            offered in to work including apprenticeships and industrial placement years. Furthermore, I
                            had the opportunity to
                            return to Newcastle University to deliver a workshop to first year students on behalf of IBM
                            which included a mock
                            interview. These activities improved my communication and presentation skills considerably.
                        </p>
                        <p>Key skills - Communication, Presentation, Teamwork</p>

                        <h5>Giveback (Side Projects)</h5>
                        <p>As part of my time at Hursley, I was encouraged to take part in 'giveback' activities, other
                            projects outside of my core role.
                            With the view to gain new skills, I helped to build a bot for Slack using the Botkit API and
                            coding in Node. In
                            addition, I worked on a project to create a web portal for interns and managers to track
                            progress during placement
                            years, using Vue, PHP and Node.</p>
